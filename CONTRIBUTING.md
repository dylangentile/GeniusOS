#Contributing Guidelines

##Commit Rules.
-All commits MUST BE GPG SIGNED, unless they were made by me before I learned how to use GPG.
-Describe what you fixed/added clearly; not too verbose, but not like dylan's commit(id est: "asdf")
-Don't contribute stupid functions. (id est: isOdd() or isEven(), just do if(x % 2 != 0) etc. )
-Be courteous.
