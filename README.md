## Building the Genius Compiler
1. First clone into ~/GeniusOS/Genius, if you don't want the OS src code.
2. Use make sure you have gcc & make, gcc version 4.2.0 or above.
3. Enter "make" into your command line.
4. ./genius Sourcecode.genius to compile your code. I recomend using a makefile for this however.
5. Also, please add genius to your path, we need your support.
