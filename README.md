# GeniusOS
It's an operating system and cross platform development environment with Genius, the programming suite, included.

## Building the Genius Compiler
1. First clone into ~/GeniusOS/Genius, if you don't want the OS src code.
2. Use make sure you have gcc & make, gcc version 4.2.0 or above.
3. Enter "make" into your command line. 
  //if this doesn't work it means I forgot to reset my personal makefile. Just goto line 9 and change the CC to equal g++
4. ./genius Sourcecode.genius to compile your code. I recomend using a makefile for this however.
5. Also, please add genius to your path, we need your support.
